# NVMe-HOMA
This is a repo which stores the diff files that we can apply to kernel tree 6.5-rc1 to get a working version of NVMe-HOMA. While developing an initial version it is easier for me to keep it as a diff file.
Once I am done working on this full time, I will make a kernel module that can be simply installed into your kernel.
